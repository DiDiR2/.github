# DiDiR2 - Direct Drive Robot 2

No reduction, no gears, no backlash, no friction, no wear, no complexity, ... Just drive!

The idea is to build the simplest mechanical robots and then try to do with them as many things as possible.
Less mechanical complexity means less failures.

DiDiR2 has 5 direct drive BLDC motors:

- 2 for locomotion
- 1 for equilibrum
- 2 for arm.
